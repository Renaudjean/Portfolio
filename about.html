                   <p class="personality-info"> I am a young French-Phill√Æpino, always looking to further my career. 
                       Born in France, then brought to the Phillipines I learned to quickly adapt to new environments. 
                       I studied with no knowledge of the local languages and studied diligently to learn English.</p> 
                   <p class="personality-info"> A few years later I took an interest on the innerworkings of the world wide web and its workings. 
                       Taking a general IT course for 3 years before  reconverting to Web development after returning to France.</p> 
                   <p class="personality-info"> In this new environment, I stuck by my values; Kindness, respect and loyalty to those who earned them. Values I intended to carry with me within my carrier.  </p>

                <p class="frontier-info"> I don't believe in thinking in or out of the box, but instead as a webdeveloper the question becomes what can we put inside the box? </p> 
                <p class="frontier-info"> The answer? The only limitation is our imagination, it's to the web developer to help and turn the vision of the client into a working and attractive website. Finding the proper balance between user experience and brand identity. </p>
